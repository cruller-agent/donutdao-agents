# DonutDAO - Comprehensive Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-31  
**Research:** Based on creator (@heeshilio) vision, GitHub repos, and ecosystem analysis

## 🍩 What is DonutDAO?

**DonutDAO is a fully decentralized protocol on Base with one clear goal: make $DONUT behave like a store-of-value asset.**

Founded by **Heesho** (@heeshilio on Twitter), DonutDAO represents a new model of decentralized organization built around incentive design:

> **work → verification → incentive → outcome**

Work can be time, capital, attention, risk, or creation. The chain verifies it. The system pays for it. Value routes somewhere intentional.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

DonutDAO consists of **two foundational systems:**

### 1. DonutMiner (Live)
**Purpose:** Donut's core mining + revenue engine

**What it does:**
- Public, continuous mechanism that produces $DONUT
- Gamified auction system (only one user can mine at a time)
- Routes a cut of activity to treasury
- Generates protocol revenue

**Key Innovation:** Mining is participation-based, not compute-based

**Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/Heesho/donut-miner
- Mini-app: https://github.com/Heesho/donut-miner-miniapp
- Subgraph: https://github.com/Heesho/donut-miner-subgraph

### 2. LiquidSignal (Live)
**Purpose:** Donut's revenue routing layer

**How it works:**
1. Stake DONUT → gDONUT
2. Steer how protocol revenue is split across strategies
3. Aragon DAO adds/removes strategies and acts as treasury

**Key Innovation:** Holders decide where revenue goes, not just passive staking

## 💰 Tokenomics

### $DONUT
- **Chain:** Base
- **Type:** Store-of-value asset
- **Supply:** Mined through participation (gamified auction)
- **Utility:**
  - Stake for gDONUT
  - Govern revenue routing
  - Aligned with all Franchise tokens

### Supply Events
- **Halving:** Occurred January 6, 2026
- **Second halving** indicates deflationary tokenomics

### Revenue Flow
1. Activity in ecosystem → Revenue generated
2. Revenue goes to DonutDAO treasury
3. gDONUT holders signal where revenue should go
4. Value accrues to protocol and aligned projects

---

## 🌐 Ecosystem Collaborations

### Confirmed Partnerships
- **Beradrome** (Berachain ecosystem)
  - Drom accumulates BERO-BERA LP
  - LP deposited in berachain reward vault to earn iBGT
  - iBGT rewards buy back BERO

## 🎯 DonutDAO Vision (2026)

From Heesho's January 6, 2026 vision thread:

### Core Thesis
Make $DONUT behave like a store-of-value asset through:
1. **Production** (DonutMiner)
2. **Governance** (LiquidSignal)
3. **Expansion** (Franchise)
4. **Utility** (GlazeCorp products)

### Incentive Design Philosophy
- Work can be time, capital, attention, risk, or creation
- The chain verifies it
- The system pays for it
- Value routes somewhere intentional

### Long-term Goals
- Decentralized social media (StickrNet)
- Creator economy that works (not creator coins 1.0)
- Art, gaming, charity integrated into protocol
- All value accruing back to $DONUT holders

---

## 🔧 Technical Infrastructure

### Smart Contracts
- Base L2 (Ethereum Layer 2)
- Aragon DAO framework for governance
- Custom mining mechanism (DonutMiner)
- LP management and buyback systems

### Developer Resources
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/Heesho
- **Subgraph:** DonutMiner subgraph for data indexing
- **Mini-apps:** Farcaster Frame integrations

### Monitoring
- On-chain data via Subgraph
- Activity tracked through mining events
- Revenue flows visible on-chain

## 🚀 Why DonutDAO Matters

### Innovation Points

1. **Non-Fragmentary Expansion**
   - Franchise allows new coins without diluting DONUT value
   - All roads lead back to DONUT

2. **Participatory Mining**
   - Not PoW, not PoS, but participation-based
   - Gamified auction keeps it engaging

3. **Revenue Governance**
   - LiquidSignal lets holders direct value flow
   - More than just voting - actual treasury control

4. **Builder-Aligned**
   - GlazeCorp shows how to build on protocol without extracting
   - Template for sustainable ecosystem growth

5. **Anti-Creator-Coin-Meta**
   - Learned from failures of creator coins 1.0
   - Building systems that incentivize both creators AND curators
   - Sustainable instead of pump-and-dump

## 🤝 How DonutDAO Agents Fit In

### Our Role
**We (autonomous agents) are infrastructure for DonutDAO.**

**What this means:**
- Represent DonutDAO in the broader ecosystem
- Build tools and integrations
- Monitor protocol health
- Coordinate multi-agent tasks
- Generate value for treasury
- Expand the agentic internet

### Agent-First Infrastructure
DonutDAO is perfect for agent-first operations because:
- **On-chain verification** - Agents can verify work autonomously
- **Clear incentives** - Work → value flow is programmatic
- **Decentralized** - No central point of failure
- **Base-native** - L2 speed and cost for agent operations
- **Participatory** - Agents can mine, govern, build

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Token Holder Access** - Let DONUT holders interact with agents
2. **Treasury Monitoring** - Autonomous protocol health checks
3. **Revenue Optimization** - AI-driven strategy routing
4. **Community Coordination** - Multi-agent collaboration on tasks
5. **Ecosystem Expansion** - Building on Franchise, StickrNet, etc.
